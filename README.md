# ALMA-Galaxy-Visibility-Modelling
This repository contains code and other documentation I wrote during the course of my co-op at HAA over the summer of 2025. My project allowed me to learn methods of image synthesis and its limitations, and test visibility modelling on data of galaxies observed by ALMA.
