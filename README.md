# ALMA Visibility Modelling
This repository contains code and other documentation I wrote during the course of my co-op at HAA over the summer of 2025. My project allowed me to learn methods of image synthesis and its limitations, and test visibility modelling on data of galaxies observed by ALMA. 

This repo contains two folders, which contain code used in two different implementations of visibility modelling. 

The radial_version folder contains code used to fit axisymmetric models defined by a radial brightness distribution. This method was tested with observations of the inner star-forming ring in NGC 3351, and produced fit models as well as products useful in the visualization of those fits. A README file in that folder goes into greater detail on that tool. 

The 2d_model_version folder contains code designed to fit models defined in a two-dimensional plane, thus allowing a greater freedom in the complexity of the model. During my summer co-op, I was not able to get this version of the code running as expected, but it is provided to show generally what this use case would look like. A README file in that folder goes into greater detail on what is included.
